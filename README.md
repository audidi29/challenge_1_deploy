# challenge_1_deploy

# Refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

This project was a challenge for me as a new web developper. 
  I was motivated by creating an user friednly and accessible website; that's why I builded it to help me improve my frontend skill. 
  The principal problem to solve was to ensure that people with disabilities can access a website and also to improve the google search optimization (SEO)
 I learned to write my code clearfully to help other developers to read it easily, how to code with semantic html element and positionning the webpage structure.
